# ABOUT
### The program index.js mainly demonstrates the three functions:
1. validatePassword(pass1, pass2)
2. reversePassword(pass)
3. storePassword(name, pass1, pass2)

### ```validatePassword(pass1, pass2)``` takes two string passwords and checks if
1. The string values of both passwords match
2. If both of them have at least one numeric character
3. If both of them have at least one upper and lowercase character
4. If both of them are at least of length 8
### Returns ```true``` if all of these conditions satisfy, ```false``` otherwise.

### ```reversePassword(pass)``` takes a string password and returns a reversed version of it.

### ```storePassword(name, pass1, pass2)``` takes strings name, pass1, and pass2. Returns an object with the keys name and newpassword. If both passwords match, then the newpassword is the reversed version of the original password, otherwise, newpassword is equal to pass1.
